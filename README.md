* #This is ***VK/KittenPHP-DB-Engine*** project, 
consisting of efficient ***PHP-to-C++*** translator called ***"KPHP"*** or ***"KittenPHP"***,
and several auxiliary high-performance **engines** (specialized non-relational databases),
needed for its deployment.

* ##It has been developed since 2009 mostly by ***Vkontakte Ltd***,
operator of social network [VK.COM](http://vk.com/), 
and thoroughfully tested in high-performance enviroments,
until a version useful for the general public was obtained. 
Fulfilling several previously given public promises, 
this version is now released for public use under ***GPL/LGPL*** terms.

* ##Source code is licensed mostly under *GPL* v2 or later 
(see file **LICENSE** for the full text and file *GPL* v2 for list of all authors).

* ##Some portions are licensed under *LGPL* v2 or later 
(see file **LICENSE.LGPL** for the full text and file **LGPL** v2 for list of all authors).
These are the files which might be later used to create a library, useful for all engines
as well as any other future third-party projects.

* ##Each source file should have a header describing its license (*GPL* or *LGPL*)
and precise list of contributors. If no such header is present, *GPL* v2 (or later)
is assumed, as described in files *GPL* v2 and **LICENSE**.
